# practical-grader

**This is the project I have done in university**

This projects demonstrate how to build an mobile application with Android Studio using Java. This application allows each teachers from different classes record every students' mathematic scores for tutorials. This application simulates the grading system in school where we can track the student's marks. Students can check their mark once the teachers published it onto the system.
